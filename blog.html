                <p><span class="bold red">Session storage</span> is similar to <span class="bold red">Local storage.
                    </span>The difference is that <span class="bold">
                        while data in localStorage doesn't expire, data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page
                        session ends. </span>Whenever a document is loaded in a particular tab in the browser, a unique
                    page session gets created and assigned to that particular tab.</p>

                <p><span class="bold red"> Event loop </span><span class="bold"> is an endless loop, which waits for
                        tasks, executes them and then
                        sleeps until it receives more tasks.</span> The event loop executes tasks from the event queue
                    only when the call stack is empty i.e. there is no ongoing task. The event loop allows us to use
                    callbacks and promises.

                <h3>ways to get undefined?</h3>
                <p>The short answer is that JavaScript interpreter returns
                    <span class="bold red"> undefined</span> when accessing a variable or object property that is not
                    yet initialized. There are many scenarios that can causes undefined. such as
                <ul class="bold">
                    i. Uninitialized variable <br>
                    ii. Accessing a non-existing property <br>
                    iii. undefined function parameters <br>
                    iv. returning undefined value from a function <br>
                    v. avoiding operators. etc
                </ul>
